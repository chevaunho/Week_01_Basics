			<h2>A creative at heart...</h2>
			<p>It was determined that I would have a career in design from the age I could hold a pen in my stubby little fingers. Throughout school, days on end were spent perfecting my colouring skills, admiring my older sister's natural painting talent, and cursing over cheap wax crayons.</p>


			<p>In 2014, I completed a Bachelor in Fashion and Textile Design. It wasn't long into studying that I began to realise my love for the digital space. Dabbling in all things Adobe, I became a self-taught digital creative. I am now an Online Editor and Content Producer from one of the largest media companies in Australia. I have since completed a course in Front End Wed Development and refined skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.</p>

			<p>My greatest passion will always be in painting. My favourite medium is oil however, experimenting with textile paints, metallics, foil and watercolours is never too far off the agenda.</p>
