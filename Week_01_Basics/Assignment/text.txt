ABOUT ME PAGE

ALWAYS A CREATIVE AT HEART
It was determined that I would have a career in design from the age I could hold a pen in my stubby little fingers. Throughout school, days on end were spent perfecting my colouring skills, admiring my older sister's natural painting talent, and cursing over cheap wax crayons. 

In 2014, I completed a Bachelor in Fashion and Textile Design. It wasn't long into studying that I began to realise my love for the digital space. Dabbling in all things Adobe, I became a self-taught digital creative. I am now an Online Editor and Content Producer from one of the largest media companies in Australia. I have since completed a course in Front End Wed Development and refined skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

My greatest passion will always be in painting. My favourite medium is oil however, experimenting with textile paints, metallics, foil and watercolours is never too far off the agenda.
